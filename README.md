# Web_Scraping_Project
this project scrapes the top news headline of Bing News From top sports, top U.S news and top world news and and displays it on a GUI. 
This code took me roughly 5 monthes to write from the monthes of May- August in the summer of 2021. I did this with zero experience of HTML or JSOUP
and very limited experience in Java gui. I have plans in the future to intergrate this into a desktop application.
